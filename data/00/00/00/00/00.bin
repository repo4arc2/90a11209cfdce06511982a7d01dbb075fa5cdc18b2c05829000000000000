Yeah, stab wounds look
consistent with the others.

Positioning of the bodies indicates
they didn't know what the hell hit 'em.

(SCOFFS) Guilty of being

all this incredibly tedious? Yes.

I suspect, the Avengers.

I came into possession of the Tesseract

with a taskforce and resources,

I can't go back, can I?

643
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,167
Back to my timeline.

644
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,292
I don't enjoy hurting people.

645
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:26,458
I... (SIGHS)

646
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:28,292
I don't enjoy it.

647
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,250
I do it because I have to,

648
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,500
because I've had to.

649
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,583
Okay, explain that to me.

650
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,458
Because it's part of the illusion.

651
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:48,417
It's the cruel, elaborate trick
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

652
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,750
A desperate play for control.

653
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,375
You do know yourself.

654
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,333
A villain. (SIGHS)

655
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,417
That's not how I see it.

656
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,083
You try to use that?

657
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,458
Oh, several times.

658
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,375
Even an Infinity Stone is useless here.

(SCOFFS)

660
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,583
The TVA is formidable.

MOBIUS: That's been my experience.

662
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,458
Listen, I can't offer you salvation,

663
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,333
but maybe I can offer you
something better.

664
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,958
A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

665
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,708
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

666
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,167
That's right.

667
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,917
Why me?

668
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,917
The Variant we're hunting is...

669
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:45,917
you.

670
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,333
I beg your pardon?

671
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,292
MINUTEMAN: Time signature
is early third millennium.

672
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,500
Definitely anachronistic.

Oil.

675
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,042
I think some jackass found himself
a time machine,

676
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,542
came back here to get rich.

677
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,667
Should we fan out and look for him, sir?

678
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:40,125
Nah. It's not worth the paperwork.

679
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,875
Just prune it. Let's bail. Set a charge.

680
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:46,042
MINUTEMAN: Wait. Someone's out there.

681
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,583
Check it out.
